Abstract

Many are the anthropogenic drivers of pollinator decline, but the loss of suitable habitats, among other effects caused 
by agricultural intensification, deserves special attention. Reduction in the availability of floral resources negatively 
affects bee communities, compromising bee species composition, foraging behavior, corporal size, and fitness. Our study 
aims to understand whether the presence of herbaceous plants, acting as foraging sites, next to crops contributes to bee 
species richness in smallholder rural properties. Bee sampling was performed on smallholder rural properties in the 
municipality of Guapiara, southern São Paulo state. Individuals who visited the flowers of ruderal plants and crops were 
collected, using an entomological net, for ten months. A total of 61 bee species were identified, with the highest species 
richness being sampled in ruderal plant flowers in the three properties studied. Only in one property, ruderal plants hosted
a more diverse bee assemblage (Shannon-Wiener and taxonomic diversity indices), but species composition differed from that sampled in crop plants (Jaccard index) in all properties. Thirty-two species were sampled exclusively in ruderal plants, versus 9 only in crops and 20 species in both types of plants. Pollen analysis showed that of the 22 species of bees that were sampled only on flowers of ruderal plants, 9 species carried pollen of tomato and one species of bee carried pollen of kabocha squash. Ruderal plants can provide an alternative food resource for pollinators, enabling these insects to remain in or be attracted to crop areas, where, in addition to visiting such plants, they also visit the cultivated plant flowers. Allowing coexistence between crops and ruderal plants, provided that the issues of plant health are observed, is a simple and low-cost measure for farmers and 
will provide both economic and environmental benefits.
